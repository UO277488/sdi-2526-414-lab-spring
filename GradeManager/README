This app executes on port 8080 since that is the default port for Spring Boot applications. You can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser after starting the application.
In the pdf it says that the app could execute on port 8090 if 8080 is occupied
by other process, but that is not the case. If you want to change the port to 8090, you can do so by adding the following line to your `application.properties` file:
```server.port=8090
```
After making this change, restart the application and it will now execute on port 8090.
